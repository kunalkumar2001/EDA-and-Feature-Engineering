# 🚀 EDA & Feature Engineering Workflow

A complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** pipeline designed to transform raw data into *model-ready and insight-driven datasets*.

This repository demonstrates industry-standard techniques through two focused modules:
- 📁 **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- 📁 **Feature Engineering**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Raw data is often messy, inconsistent, and unpredictable. This project provides a **step-by-step approach** to understand the data, extract key insights, and engineer features that improve data quality and model performance.

This workflow is essential for:
- Data Analysts  
- Data Scientists  
- Machine Learning Engineers  
- BI Professionals
